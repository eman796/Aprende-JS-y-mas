        I just can't leave you alone
        Can we get even closer, babe? Get closer (closer)
        I know you only just met me
        우릴 서로 당긴 gravity
        아무 말조차 없어도 이미 it's telepathy
        착각하게 만드는 건지? Mmm-mmm
        운명 아닌 거라면 설명해 봐 내게
        떨려오는 숨결이 말해
        I could be wrong
        But 내게 보내온 너의 신호, baby, me too
        I could be wrong
        But 너도 준비가 된 것 같고, baby, me too, me too (woo)
        I just can't leave you alone
        Can we get even closer, babe? Get closer, babe
        Oh, I just can't leave you alone
        Can we get even closer, babe? Get closer (mmm-mmm)
        I don't know what you mean to me
        네게 난 어떤 의미인지?
        상관없어, make it easy
        Tell me where this is heading?
        속도가 붙은 발걸음을 너에게로
        불꽃이 붙은 now, lights on
        I could be wrong
        But 내게 보내온 너의 신호, baby, me too (baby, me too)
        I could be wrong
        But 너도 준비가 된 것 같고, baby, me too, me too (woo)
        I just can't leave you alone
        Can we get even closer, babe? Get closer, babe
        Oh, I just can't leave you alone (ah-ah)
        Can we get even closer, babe? Get closer (yeah, woo)
        La-la-la (ooh)
        La-la-la, la-la-la (ooh)
        La-la-la (oh, whoa, whoa, whoa)
        La-la-la (woo), la-la-la (oh, whoa, whoa, babe)</pre>
